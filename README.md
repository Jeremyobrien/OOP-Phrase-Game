# OOP-Phrase-Game
A browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." This leverages JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase. A player tries to guess the phrase by selecting individual letters from an onscreen keyboard. Can they guess the phrase before they run out of attempts?
